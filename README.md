In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect AI-generated content from text data. Using various natural language processing techniques like TF-IDF vectorization, I transformed the text data and built classification models including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and neural networks. To address data imbalance, I implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. This project showcases my ability to handle imbalanced datasets, build robust classification models, and work with both traditional machine learning and deep learning frameworks.
